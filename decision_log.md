# Decision Log - Smart Thermostat Project

This document records all significant technical decisions made during the Smart Thermostat project, including alternatives considered and reasoning behind choices.

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Property-Centric Architecture
**Decision**: Organize the application around properties as the central entity, with thermostats and calendars as property-specific resources.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Thermostat-centric architecture
- User-centric architecture

**Reasoning**:
- Properties are the natural organizational unit for vacation rentals and buildings
- Multiple thermostats can exist within a single property
- Calendar events are typically property-specific
- This structure aligns with how property managers think about their business

### 2. Multi-Brand Thermostat Support
**Decision**: Implement a modular architecture with brand-specific client implementations behind a unified interface.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Support only one thermostat brand
- Create separate applications for each brand
- Use third-party integration service

**Reasoning**:
- Property managers often have different thermostat brands across properties
- Modular architecture allows easy addition of new brands
- Unified interface simplifies frontend development
- Factory pattern provides clean separation of concerns

### 3. Frontend Framework Selection
**Decision**: Use React with TypeScript and Vite.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Angular
- Vue.js
- Plain JavaScript

**Reasoning**:
- React's component model fits the UI requirements
- TypeScript provides type safety and better developer experience
- Vite offers faster development and build times
- This stack has strong community support and extensive libraries

### 4. Backend Framework Selection
**Decision**: Use Django REST Framework.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Express.js (Node)
- Flask (Python)
- Ruby on Rails

**Reasoning**:
- Django's admin interface provides immediate value
- REST Framework simplifies API development
- Python ecosystem has strong support for IoT integrations
- Built-in authentication and permission systems

## Implementation Decisions

### 1. Authentication Method
**Decision**: Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Session-based authentication
- OAuth 2.0
- API keys

**Reasoning**:
- JWTs are stateless and work well with REST APIs
- Supports mobile applications in the future
- Simplifies server-side implementation
- djangorestframework-simplejwt provides ready-to-use implementation

### 2. Test Mode Implementation
**Decision**: Implement a test mode that uses mock data instead of real API calls.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Sandbox environment
- API simulation layer
- Test-only deployment

**Reasoning**:
- Allows development without backend connectivity
- Simplifies testing of UI components
- Provides consistent data for demos
- Reduces dependency on external services during development

### 3. Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD and Render for hosting.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Jenkins + AWS
- CircleCI + Heroku
- GitLab CI + Digital Ocean

**Reasoning**:
- GitHub Actions integrates directly with code repository
- Render provides simple deployment for both frontend and backend
- Cost-effective for current project scale
- Automated workflow reduces manual deployment steps

## Troubleshooting Decisions

### 1. ZIP Structure for Deployment
**Decision**: Place frontend/ and backend/ directories at the root level of deployment ZIP.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate ZIPs for frontend and backend
- Different directory naming conventions
- Using Git branches instead of ZIPs

**Reasoning**:
- GitHub Action workflow expects specific directory paths
- Single ZIP simplifies deployment process
- Root-level directories are easier to locate in workflow
- Consistent structure reduces deployment errors

### 2. TypeScript Configuration
**Decision**: Use strict TypeScript checking.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Looser TypeScript configuration
- Gradual typing adoption
- Runtime type checking

**Reasoning**:
- Catches errors at compile time rather than runtime
- Improves code quality and maintainability
- Provides better developer experience with IDE support
- Reduces bugs in production

### 3. Backend Dependencies Management
**Decision**: Use explicit requirements.txt with pinned versions.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Poetry
- Pipenv
- Docker-based dependency management

**Reasoning**:
- Simple and widely understood
- Compatible with Render deployment
- Explicit versions prevent dependency conflicts
- Easy to maintain and update

## Future Considerations

### 1. Mobile Application
**Decision**: Defer mobile app development until web application is stable.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simultaneous web and mobile development
- Mobile-first approach
- Progressive Web App (PWA)

**Reasoning**:
- Focus resources on core functionality first
- Web application provides immediate value
- API design can consider mobile needs for future compatibility
- Reduces initial development complexity

### 2. Analytics Integration
**Decision**: Plan for future analytics integration with separate module.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Built-in analytics from the start
- Third-party analytics service
- Custom analytics implementation

**Reasoning**:
- Core functionality takes priority
- Modular design allows adding analytics later
- Separate module maintains clean architecture
- Allows time to determine specific analytics requirements

### 3. Scaling Strategy
**Decision**: Design for horizontal scaling with stateless components.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Vertical scaling
- Serverless architecture
- Monolithic deployment

**Reasoning**:
- Horizontal scaling provides better long-term flexibility
- Stateless design works well with cloud infrastructure
- Easier to handle increased load as user base grows
- Compatible with current deployment strategy
